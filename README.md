# Module 3 Challenge

## Description
This Module 3 Challenge was created for the Front-End Web Developer boot camp students. The website was built to teach and reinforce the basics of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Git. We used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a portfolio.

What I learnt?

I learnt more about how to effectively use Git Hub and Git Bash.
I learnt that commit messages are meant to be specific to improvement/changes made in code.
I learnt a ton of material: HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap.
